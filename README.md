* undefined means a variable has been declared but not assigned a value yet. It’s the default state set by JavaScript.
* null is an intentional assignment that represents “no value” or “empty value”.

* Use of map() and difference from forEach()
map() is used to transform elements of an array and returns a new array with modified values.
forEach() simply executes a function for each element and does not return a new array.

* Difference between == and ===
== (loose equality) compares values after type conversion.
=== (strict equality) compares both value and type without conversion.

* Significance of async/await in fetching API data

async/await simplifies working with asynchronous operations like API calls by making the code look synchronous and easier to read.
async makes a function return a Promise.
await pauses execution until the Promise resolves.

*Scope in JavaScript (Global, Function, Block)

Scope determines where variables are accessible.
Global Scope
Variables declared outside any function or block are accessible everywhere.
Function Scope
Variables declared inside a function are accessible only within that function.
Block Scope
Variables declared with let or const inside {} are accessible only within that block.
